  <h3><b>Chester Charles Bennington (March 20, 1976 â€“ July 20, 2017) was an American singer, songwriter, and occasional actor. He was best known as the lead vocalist for Linkin Park </b></h3>
  <p><i>Bennington first gained prominence as a vocalist following the release of Linkin Park's debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), which was a worldwide commercial success. The album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005, making it the best-selling debut album of the decade, as well as one of the few albums ever to achieve that many sales.[2] Linkin Park's following studio albums, from Meteora (2003) to One More Light (2017), continued the band's success.</i></p>
  <p><i>Bennington struggled with depression and substance abuse for most of his life, starting in his childhood.[4] On July 20, 2017, he was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California; his death was ruled a suicide by hanging. Hit Parader magazine placed Bennington at number 46 on their list of the "Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time". Writing for Billboard, Dan Weiss stated that Bennington "turned nu-metal universal".</i></p>
